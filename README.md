# About this project

This project aims at building a web App that automatically estimates food attributes such as ingredients and nutritional
value by classifying the input image of food. Our method employs Clarifai's AI-Driven Food Detection Model for accurate 
food identification and Food API's to give the nutritional value of the identified food.

# Project Overview
In today's world, obesity is becoming a major problem. Therefore, we need a system that can influence people's eating habits and give them guidance leading to healthy lifestyle maintenance. If a system alerts users to the nutritional information of a food item and categorises it as healthy or unhealthy as well as the nutrition content to the user, they can establish their daily intake of calories from their diet. First, we must determine the type of food, and then, after predicting the type of food (fruit or vegetable), our system must determine the type of that image (if the image is in the category of food or vegetable). A combination of deep learning techniques is used to recognise the image and determine the category based on it. Our approach incorporates a wide range of segmentation and picture features.
